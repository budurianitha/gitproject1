<h2 style="color:red"> Introduction to HIV/AIDS</h2>
<p style="color:maroon; text-align: justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
<h2>The first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the United States in the spring of 1981. By 1983 the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
the virus that causes AIDS, had been isolated.Early in the U.S. HIV/AIDS pandemic, the role of substance abuse in the spread of AIDS was clearly established.</h2>
<h2> Injection drug use (IDU) was identified as a direct route of HIV infection and transmission among injection drug users. The largest group of early AIDS cases comprised gay and bisexual men (referred to as men who have sex with menâ€”or MSMs). Early cases of HIV infection that were sexually transmitted often were related 
to the use of alcohol and other substances, and the majority of these cases occurred in urban, educated, white MSMs.
